# Overview

## On the Method
* The structure and character of metaphysical concepts
* Foundationalism, radicalism, birth from ashes: the holocaust logic of modernism
* Method, algorithm, theorem.

## Eurocentrism in Mathematical Thought
* The universality of mathematics
  * Sagan's claim
  * 
* The foundational project of the 20th century was a project of staking a claim.
* The ubiquity of the calculus (and Leibniz's defense of the honor of Germany)

## Artificial intelligence.
* Intelligence is a metaphysical ground. It is not directly measurable unless it is radically redefined.
* Turing's test, and problems with the Russell & Norvig characterization.

## The completed infinite.
* The full presence of the set forces a completed infinite.
* The continuum.
* The mathematical objection.

## Conclusion: Programmable Logic and Grammatology
* The change within logic


## On the Method
Begin with the anecdote of the Method of Mechanical Theorems

The purpose of this dissertation is to show how Derrida's critique of metaphysics applies to the foundation of computer science.

### Calculus and Foundations
A history of the rise of method, and the struggle to contain it.

### Western Mathematics
The political aspects of Hilbert's endeavor.
A certain concept of the human and of "intelligence."

### Hilbert's Program in the Epoch of the Logos
Locating the project of mathematics within the epoch of the logos.

## Derrida and Turing: Two Critiques of Metaphysics

### Artificial Intelligence and Computation

### Intelligence, Truth, Mathematics
A certain definition of intelligence. Grasping the ungraspable (or uncountable)--Plato's idea of perceiving the forms. Connection to the a priori---the world beyond this world. Has to do with an ability to perceive / discover / know timeless truths. Cannot simply be a behavior. (Argument from Consciousness). So, it's not just that there are forms that must be grasped, but an immaterial thing that can grasp them. Intelligence is the Platonic form of the brain. So intelligence is a manifestation of the immaterial subject. It is the self before _all_ behavior. The Cogito underscores this definition. The _res cogitans_. The domain of this creature is ideality. So it goes with a concept of mathematics involving definition and proof. 
Perhaps Abe Stone's mathematics as "power".

It is hostile to method.

### Metaphysical Centers and Turing's Objections

### Writing, In Viva Voce

## The Set as Representation of Presence

Takeaway:
That what happened in mathematics is part of a redefinition of the metaphysical concepts: truth, knowledge, identity, intelligence. To a paradigm where we have a breakdown of the dialectic between interiority and exteriority. But also we find that there was something about the mind that hoped to exceed itself, or was founded in a sublime formation, and this too was part of the ambition of modernism and the quest for foundations.

There was an attempt to contain incompleteness with closure---the same closure in a way as the closure offered in the culture of the book.

We might say the is a second species of "center"---the always beyond.
