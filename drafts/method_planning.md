### Mechanical Method
* The story of the Archmedes palimpsest
  * Mechanical Method
  * Abelson's procedural epistemology
  * Connection to the infinitesimal calculus
* The Age of Calculi
  * Infinitesimal:
    * Newton, Leibniz, nationalism
    * Implication 1: more general calculus 
    * Implication 2: need for new foundations
    * The merging of these two projects in the foundational program
  * Calculus Ratiocinator
  * Lambda calculus
    * Continuous with Frege: functional approach
    * Equivalent to Turing
* The search for Foundations
  * Partly to control the calculus
  * History of the infinitesimals and their threat
  * The method had raced ahead.
  * Need a foundation for it means reasserting the primacy of the theory.
  * The problem is what the calculus did to geometry, the new logic did to logic. It became infected with method and mechanism.

### The Critique of Structure
* Saussure
* Jakobsen
* Levi Strauss
* Derrida
* Writing and Logic

Levi Strauss also trying to achieve objectivity.
Trying to elevate above the horizon.
A different kind of dream
Attempt to find a foundation--universal truths
Science in the humanities.
Comes out of linguistics--science of language.
On truth and lies.

The ascendance of method

This chapter needs to get through several ideas to set up what follows. I should begin with the story of the palimpsest as evidence of the focus on theorem over method. So there is the story of this palimpsest, and what it means.

* Discovered in 1906 by Heiberg. Published in 1915. So perfect timing.
* The Method of Mechanical Theorems

This connects with the Calculus.
Could be paired with Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs to suggest a rise of the algorithm.
 
The development of the calculus was a European, nationalist project. The correspondence between Newton and Leibniz offer ample evidence of this.

The calculus was the basis for a need for new foundations.

These foundations are what drove the movement toward foundationalism that ultimately gave rise to computer science. A story of method.

Method against foundation?

Speech and foundation:

The goals of the Cartesian project of rationalism. Beyond the human.

The other calculus (calculus raciniator), also from Leibniz. Very much a mechanical process and a method. A mechanical method of reasoning in general.


Method and Writing:

The idea of foundation.
