# Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to explain the connection between the critique of metaphysics and the foundations of mathematics.

## The Method of Mechanical Theorems


## The Method of this dissertation
Why apply Derrida to the foundations of mathematics?

The war against time.
* Desire to prevent unexpected change.
* From the calendar to the computation.
* Perfection: a universe that is already complete, known, flawless.

### Dramatic Reconfiguration of the World
* Discovery of the Americas (1492)
* Protestant Reformation (1517)
* Gregorian Calendar (officially initiated 1545, implemented 1582, The problem of Easter)
* Nicolaus Copernicus (1473 - 1543, On the Revolutions of Celestial Spheres, 1543, inspired by calendar reform)

## The Age of Calculi
* Johannes Kepler (1571-1630, Laws of Planetary Motion, 1609-1619)
* Galileo Galilei (1564-1642, The Discourses, 1638, esp. The Law of Falling Bodies)
* Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598 - 1647, The Method of Indivisibles, 1635)
* Francis Bacon (Novum Organum 1630s)
* Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan and the Infinitesimal 1651)
* Isaac Newton (1642 - 1726, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, 1687, Infinitesimal Calculus 1669)
* Leibniz (1646-1716, Infinitesimal Calculus 1675)
* Leibniz's calculus ratiocinator
* Daniel Bernoulli (1700 - 1782)
* Leonhard Euler (1707 - 1783)
* Encyclopedists (1751 - 1765, Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert)
* Evariste Galois (1811-1832)
* Bernard Bolzano (1781 - 1848)
* Boole (1815 - 1864)
* Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) (Against completed infinity 1831 letter to Heinrich Schumacher)
* Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss and Farkas Bolyai (Non-Euclidean Geometry, 1829)
* Charles Darwin (On the Origin of Species, 1859)
* Putnam's Mathematical Truth: empirical methods
* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (1984)
* The ultimate trend of this group to place the natural sciences at the foundation, inverting the relationship between the a priori and empirical
* But structuralism justly claims to be the critique of empiricism

## New Foundations
* Thomas Aquinas (1225 - 1274)
* Rene Descartes's Cogito (1637) An indication of the recognition that the foundations were not secure
  * Note Descartes' involvement with astronomy / heliocentric models / Galileo
  * 3 dreams: Idea to apply mathematical (geometric) method to philosophy.
  * Travel: diversity of customs
  * Education: diversity of opinions of philosophers
* John Locke (An Essay Concerning Human Understanding 1689)
* David Hume (1711 - 1776)
* Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778, Discourse on Inequality 1755, The Social Contract 1762)

* Georg Cantor (1874-84)
* Gottlob Frege (Logicist) (Concept Script 1879)
* Richard Dedekind (Logicist), Continuity and Irrational Numbers (1872), What are Numbers and What are They For? (1888)
* Edmund Husserl (Philosophy of Arithmetic, 1891)
* Bertrand Russell (Logicist) Principia Mathematica (1910-1913)
* Alfred Whitehead (Logicist) Principia Mathematica (1910-1913)
  * (Echo of Newton Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica)
* Ernst Zermelo (Axiomatization 1908)
* Abraham Fraenkel (improved axiomatization 1922, 1925)
* Thoralf Skolem (work on Zermelo's axioms in 1922)
* David Hilbert (On the Infinite, 1925, Entscheidungsproblem 1928)
* Kurt Godel (Incompleteness 1931) 
* Alan Turing (Computable Numbers, 1936)

## Modernism, Coloniality
* Nationalism
  * Calculus
  * Turing and the Enigma machine (again England vs Germany)
* Starting again.
* Achieving objectivity.
* Reaching beyond the human.
* Above all a project of producing new language, as if somehow the weakness of humanity was a weakness of language.
* Looking for a language of truth.

## Structuralism


## Anthropology
* The language of myth.
* Objectivity, Coloniality, Eurocentrism

## Derrida
* Critique of Husserl
* Critique of Levi Strauss 



## The critique of structure
* What is centered structure? 

## scratch
In the preface the editors lament that Wittgenstein and other major sources had to be omitted for lack of space, a very practical and reasonable opinion that is nonetheless amusing in light of the fact that the volume contains no less than 4 contributions by the editors themselves. A testament to objectivity!

Hegel, Rousseau, Bolzano, Brentano, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Tarski
