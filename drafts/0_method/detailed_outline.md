# On The Method

## The Method of Mechanical Theorems

### Story of the palimpsest

### A sign of the times
* other examples

## The Strategy of This Text
* Consider the story of calculus and foundation.
* Understand it as continous with:
  * Enlightenment quest for objectivity.
  * Modernist gesture of replacing old bad foundations.
  * Desire to transcend human limitations, subjectivity, and politics.
* Consider a wider arc: part of the story of speech and writing.
* Look at how this framework applies to:
  * the metaphysics of intelligence
  * the relationship between mathematical knowledge and procedural knowledge (mathematical objection)
  * the relationship between our number system and the continuum of time and space (physics)
    * Including part-whole relationships of infinite sets
    * also inexpressibility / unknowability
    * In exchange for the appearance of uniformity, completeness
* The argument is that another shift is in process, in which method becomes the reference.
  * This is not complete, nor can it be understood as a complete divestment from logocentrism,
  * Rather, it is a further stage in this reconfiguration.

## The Lesser Arc: The Algorithm and the theorem
* The calendar reform was an effort to assert control over space and time, to subordinate it to a divine or natural law that was timeless, unchanging, and beyond the material world.
* Its success came at great cost: only by moving heaven and earth.
* This dislocation produced a crisis that was never to be resolved.
* The efforts to restore foundation, by their failures, instead began to describe in the negative a new paradigm.
* Ultimately, a modified mathematics that could not ignore space and time.
* This became a mathematics of procedure, or method, algorithm, computation.
* Under the name "computer science," it increasingly challenges the paradigm of the theorem.
* To take this point of view is to question the "limitation" of the power of the algorithm, and instead challenge the beliefs of the set-theoretical universe.

### The Problem of Easter
How we realized we needed new foundations.
* Calendar reform
* Age of discovery
* A great "dislocation"

### Philosophical Foundations
* Descartes
* Kant
* Russell

### Mathematical Foundations
* Russell
* Frege
* Hilbert

### Collapse, 1
* Godel
* Turing

## The Greater Arc: Speech and writing
Picks up again from philosophy.

## The Human Sciences 
Further pursuit of foundations, this time from empirical study of the other.
* Linguistics
* Semiotics
* Anthropology

### Structuralism and the figure of the center
* Generalization of foundational efforts
* Contradictory coherence

### Collapse, 2
* Critique of metaphysics, structure
* Connection to foundationalism in general
* Speech and Writing throughout western philosophy

### Coppernican shifts: alternative views of failed foundations
* Rather than seeing computation as limited, one could instead think of mathematics as delusional.

### Coda / transition to first chapter
* Nonphonetic writing and computation.
* 

### TODO
* The scientific method
* Philosophy of science
