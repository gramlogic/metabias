Audience

As much as possible to the general reader
Does not perform fluency in disciplinary dialect associated with doctoral work.
May be less concise than otherwise and may repeat things experts consider obvious.
But necessary to communicate the whole to readers in several fields.

The algorithmic invasion.
Uncountable numbers: perhaps another Coppernican reversal. That we again change point of view from
the mathematical to the algorithmic.

After palimpsest: other examples of the shift.

## scratch
In the preface the editors lament that Wittgenstein and other major sources had to be omitted for lack of space, a very practical and reasonable opinion that is nonetheless amusing in light of the fact that the volume contains no less than 4 contributions by the editors themselves. A testament to objectivity!

Hegel, Rousseau, Bolzano, Brentano, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Tarski


## Structure, Subjectivity and Objectivity

The properties of the Judeo Christian God have canonically been described as:
* omniscience
* omnipotence
* omnipresence

Humans who aspired toward this kind of godhood were willing to forgo the prefix, and settle for science, potency and presence. That is, to know, to create, to exist.

The third of these is the most subtle, though it is important.

Oddly enough, the first two powers are divided almost too neatly into the academic domains of the sciences and the humanities. The former attempts to establish objective truth and the latter, traditionally, affirms and celebrates expressions of free will and individuality.

Structure frustrates all 3 of these desires.

...

There are two obvious desires that structure frustrates:
* The desire for truth. This amounts to objective, irrefutable knowledge. It represents a kind of power over the world. It is apparently opposed to subjective belief.
* The desire for choice. This is typically associated with the subject.

These two powers are diminished species of omniscient and omnipotence. The "omni" is not necessary; we will settle for science and potency. The latter, potency, the ability to make free choices is also exercised through creativity, intuition, art, and other expressions of the "soul."



What these desires hope to establish is the angelic nature of the human. It is a project that aims toward acension.

The ability to create artificial intelligence (life) would be an affirmation of potency.

### 3 stories

First, artificial intelligence. This is the story of how non-phonetic writing developed to a point where it directly confronts the metaphysical foundations of the res cogitans. Here we see that intelligence itself has been thought as a metaphysically grounded structure, and that the Turing Test, and it's implied behavioral definition of intelligence, removes these foundations, as though with a cut of Occam's razor.

The subtle point is that one of the ways in which human intelligence claimed superiority is in the mathematical argument: that machines have "limitations" as to what they can compute.

In the second story, we illustrate the metaphysical character of the mathematical argument. This chapter shows how choices relating to the foundations of number, and in particular the choice of the set as a foundational object, are related to a metaphysics of presence that subordinates "process" and "becoming." These foundations lead to the acceptance of the completed infinite, and therefore the belief in sets of numbers that can be defined but not computed. (May need to go back to Turing's proof for this to show that it relies on the completed infinite, as does all diagonalization.)

In the third story, we show how the acceptance of the completed infinite forces several counterintuitive conclusions:
* the violation of the part-whole relationship of finite sets, via a kind of "information loss" at infinity
* the inexpressibility of almost all numbers

How acceptance of these counter-intuitive propositions is achieved:
* The insistence on cardinality as the primary measure of "size"
* The construction narrative.

And also that these are weighed against the following advantages:
* The uniformity and completeness of the continuum, thus a kind of mathematical mastery of time and space.
* This is a vestige of the same project.
