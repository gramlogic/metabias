# The Method of Mechanical Theorems

## Freewrite

In 1906 the classical philologist Johan Ludvig Heiberg at the University of Copenhagen was revising his chronology of the works of Archimedes when his colleague Hermann Schöne in Konigsberg drew his attention to a note appearing in the fourth volume of a catalog of Greek codices found in the libraries of Jerusalem. The catalog, compiled by Athanasios Papadopoulos-Kerameus, mentioned that the 355th manuscript, a prayer book, was a palimpsest in which partially erased mathematical writings were still legible. The catalog quoted a few short examples, which proved sufficient for Heidberg to identify the author as Archimedes. The celebrated series of events that followed led to the recovery of several ancient texts.

Perhaps foremost among the discoveries was The Method of Mechanical Theorems, a letter from Archimedes to his student Eratosthenes explaining the process by which he came to the first assertion of the theorems that he proved in other work. In the introduction to his English translation of text recovered by Heidberg, Sir Thomas Little Heath writes

"The _Method_, so happily recovered, is of the greatest interest for the following reason. Nothing is more characteristic of the classical works of the great geometers of Greece, or more tantalising, than the absence of any indication of the steps by which they worked their way to the discovery of their great theorems. As they have come down to us, htese theorems are finished masterpieces which leave no traces of any rough-hewn stage, no hint of the method by which they were evolved. We cannot but suppose that the Greeks had some method or methods of analysis hardly less powerful than those of modern analysis; yet, in general, they seem to have taken pains to clear away all traces of the machinery used and all the litter, so to speak, resulting from tentative efforts, before they permitted themselves to publish, in sequence carefully thought out, and with definitive and rigorously scientific proofs, the results obtained."

This excitement persists to the present day. Reviel Netz writes that now "many think of the Method as Archimedes' most interesting work." [link](http://archimedespalimpsest.org/about/scholarship/archimedes-manuscript.php) The possibility of this attitude is striking given what Heath and Archimedes himself point out was evidently a low regard for "unfinished" work among ancient Greek mathematicians. And while Archimedes indicates a rare belief that explaining his method might be useful,  

...he is at the same time careful to insist on the difference between (1) the means which may be sufficient to suggest the truth of the theorems, although not furnishing scientific proofs of them, and (2) the rigorous demonstrations of them by irrefragable geometrical methods which must follow before they can be finally accepted as established; to use Archimedes' own terms, the former enable theorems to be _investigated_ ("theorein", consider) but not to be _proved_ ("apodeiknunai", prove)

Though the circumstances of the recovery of this work appear riddled with contingency---if the manuscript had not been repurposed, or if it had been more thoroughly erased, for example, it could easily have been permanently lost---still its story calls attention to a shift within intellectual thought in the status of the concept of method itself. The manuscript could only have been lost at a time when method was held in low esteem. Its rise to pre-eminence is indicative of a rise of method itself.

The 1906 discovery of this manuscript may be considered a sign of the times.
Many other indicators announce the present moment as occuring within an age of method. From the ascendance of the scientific method as a foundation of knowledge that aspires to challenge (or even dispell) western metaphysics.

to the establishment of computer science---a study of algorithm, procedure, method---as a discipline independent of mathematics, and with equal or greater status as an intellectual pursuit. Such that in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman can speak of it as a project of developing a "procedural epistemology" to rival the "definitional knowledge" of traditional mathematics.

This moment and mechanism of this shift are of interest in the present work.

Athanasios Papadopoulos-Kerameus was appointed secretary of the Greek Literary Club of Constantinople and made responsible of creating an inventory of all Greek manuscripts belonging to schools, churches and monasteries. As part of this work, he created a catalog of all the Greek codices in the libraries of Jerusalem and Palestine. The catalog was called _Jerusalem Library_, and naturally attracted the interest of classical philogists. The fourth volume of this catalog, published in 1899 noted that one of the books

### What Happened
### Significance
* On the one hand, the discovery seems precarious, accidental.
* On the other hand, it indicates a profound change in the conditions of reading texts.
* Low regard for method.
* Prayer book!
* Something about intelligence and artifice (save for ch 1?)
* It could only have been lost in a time when method was less important.
* The excitement around its reception indicates that it reappeared in a time when there was renewed interest in method.
* There was a method after all!
* After the invention of the calculus, we could recognize its early prefigurations. 
* Moreover--that it's foundations were in physics!!
* So much for the belief that "mathematicians have been there before"
* How do we account for this shift, and what might such a shift tell us about the future?
  * First, see it within the context of several hundred years of thought kicked off by a calendar reform.
  * Second, see it within an even broader trajectory of western metaphysics.

## Recovery of the Palimpsest
Owing to a series of lucky coincidences, two lost manuscripts of Archimedes were discovered in an old prayer book.

Sunday, August 4, 1907, the NYT reported a palimpsest found at Constantinople was of extreme interest, and the government of Turkey was resisting efforts to study it.

Prof. Schione informed Heiberg, who went to Constantinople and was aided by Turkish librarian Nicholas Tsoukaladskis.

"The original writing is in a beautiful brown ink"

Assisted by Prof H. G. Zeuthen.

"it is stated that it is of peculiar value because unlike the previously known works of Archimedes it does not contain only bare mathematical and mechanical formulae, but explains how Archimedes obtained his knolwedge through various methods and gives a wonderful insight into the mind of this great philosopher--one of the most wonderful minds that has ever existed."
