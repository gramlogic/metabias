On the Method of Mechanical Theorems to Eratosthenes

"Nothing is more characteristic of the classical works of the great geometers of Greece, or more tantalising, than the absence of any indication of the steps by which they worked their way to the discovery of their great theorems. As they have come down to us, htese theorems are finished masterpieces which leave no traces of any rough-hewn stage, no hint of the method by which they were evolved. We cannot but suppose that the Greeks had some method or methods of analysis hardly less powerful than those of modern analysis; yet, in general, they seem to have taken pains to clear away all traces of the machinery used and all the litter, so to speak, resulting from tentative efforts, before they permitted themselves to publish, in sequence carefully thought out, and with definitive and rigorously scientific proofs, the results obtained.

...he is at the same time careful to insist on the difference between (1) the means which may be sufficient to suggest the truth of the theorems, although not furnishing scientific proofs of them, and (2) the rigorous demonstrations of them by irrefragable geometrical methods which must follow before they can be finally accepted as established; to use Archimedes' own terms, the former enable theorems to be _investigated_ ("theorein", consider) but not to be _proved_ ("apodeiknunai", prove)
" --Thomas Little Heath, The method o Archimedes, recently discovered by Heiberg; a supplement to the Works of Archimedes, 1897




### What Happened
### Significance
* On the one hand, the discovery seems precarious, accidental.
* On the other hand, it indicates a profound change in the conditions of reading texts.
* Low regard for method.
* Prayer book!
* Something about intelligence and artifice (save for ch 1?)
* It could only have been lost in a time when method was less important.
* The excitement around its reception indicates that it reappeared in a time when there was renewed interest in method.
* There was a method after all!
* After the invention of the calculus, we could recognize its early prefigurations. 
* Moreover--that it's foundations were in physics!!
* So much for the belief that "mathematicians have been there before"
* How do we account for this shift, and what might such a shift tell us about the future?
  * First, see it within the context of several hundred years of thought kicked off by a calendar reform.
  * Second, see it within an even broader trajectory of western metaphysics.

## Recovery of the Palimpsest
Owing to a series of lucky coincidences, two lost manuscripts of Archimedes were discovered in an old prayer book.

Sunday, August 4, 1907, the NYT reported a palimpsest found at Constantinople was of extreme interest, and the government of Turkey was resisting efforts to study it.

Prof. Schione informed Heiberg, who went to Constantinople and was aided by Turkish librarian Nicholas Tsoukaladskis.

"The original writing is in a beautiful brown ink"

Assisted by Prof H. G. Zeuthen.

"it is stated that it is of peculiar value because unlike the previously known works of Archimedes it does not contain only bare mathematical and mechanical formulae, but explains how Archimedes obtained his knolwedge through various methods and gives a wonderful insight into the mind of this great philosopher--one of the most wonderful minds that has ever existed."
