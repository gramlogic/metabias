# The Method of Mechanical Theorems

### What Happened
### Significance
* On the one hand, the discovery seems precarious, accidental.
* On the other hand, it indicates a profound change in the conditions of reading texts.
* Low regard for method.
* Prayer book!
* Something about intelligence and artifice (save for ch 1?)
* It could only have been lost in a time when method was less important.
* The excitement around its reception indicates that it reappeared in a time when there was renewed interest in method.
* There was a method after all!
* After the invention of the calculus, we could recognize its early prefigurations. 
* Moreover--that it's foundations were in physics!!
* So much for the belief that "mathematicians have been there before"
* How do we account for this shift, and what might such a shift tell us about the future?
  * First, see it within the context of several hundred years of thought kicked off by a calendar reform.
  * Second, see it within an even broader trajectory of western metaphysics.

## Recovery of the Palimpsest
Owing to a series of lucky coincidences, two lost manuscripts of Archimedes were discovered in an old prayer book.

Sunday, August 4, 1907, the NYT reported a palimpsest found at Constantinople was of extreme interest, and the government of Turkey was resisting efforts to study it.

Prof. Schione informed Heiberg, who went to Constantinople and was aided by Turkish librarian Nicholas Tsoukaladskis.

"The original writing is in a beautiful brown ink"

Assisted by Prof H. G. Zeuthen.

"it is stated that it is of peculiar value because unlike the previously known works of Archimedes it does not contain only bare mathematical and mechanical formulae, but explains how Archimedes obtained his knolwedge through various methods and gives a wonderful insight into the mind of this great philosopher--one of the most wonderful minds that has ever existed."
