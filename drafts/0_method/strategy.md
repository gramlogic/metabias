This moment and mechanism of this shift are of interest in the present work.

* Describe a particular historical narrative as following a trajectory that fits within a larger arc and larger trajectory.
* This larger trajectory is the history of metaphysics.
* The purpose of the chapter is to show that the history of the foundations of mathematics is very much a part of this larger history.
* The history of metaphysics, what Derrida calls a substitution of center for center, might also be understood as the story of the center.
* And the center a thing that presented itself as an object or a structure, but turned out to be at least equally or perhaps better described as a method or a strategy for relating to the world.
* This method was used time and again, perhaps especially in the foundations of mathematics.
* But ultimately it is a strategy that cannot be forever sustained.
* And this realization means that every domain of knowledge in which it was adopted will feel the implications of its decline.
* The reason to explain this is to show some specific examples of things that relied on this method.
* The first of these will be "intelligence" or "the mind", a project which has always been threatened by technology and automation.
* The second will be a concept of number that is surprisingly tied to this metaphysical notion of the human mind.
  * I will show how the metaphysics of presence leads to a concept of number that encodes certain religious beliefs into mathematics.
* Finally, I look at the implications of this metaphysics for our view of continuity, and therefore space and time.

Observe that philosophical inquiry must relate to the sciences. 
It cannot be isolated from the sciences. 
We ask what the critique of metaphysics can tell us about mathematics.
We ask how the critique of metaphysics can provide insight into the claims of mathematics.
It may be the case that it cannot. Some may believe there is no such relationship.
But the premise of metaphysics is that there must be a relationship.
The premise of metaphysics---the science of first principles---is that there must be a relationship.
If there is not, it will tell us something about metaphysics.
For now I proceed on the assumption that there is such a relationshp, which is my belief.
I will make the case that there is a relationship.
The case will be developed along conceptual and historical lines.
What I want to show is that a particular historical narrative focused on 20th century Europe is in fact part of a much larger trend in western thought, in what Derrida describes as the Epoch of the logos. I will need to say what that phrase entails.
That it is motivated by the characteristic motivations of that epoch, that it was executed in a characteristic manner, and that it's failure is a point of evidence in favor of the critique of this epoch.
The critique of this epoch is a critique of metaphysics.
Once this broad correlation is established, we can use it as a framework for understanding several aspects of this history.
For example, how we interpret the project of artificial intelligence, what this project represents, what anxieties it produces, and what remedies are required.
For example, how we interpret the decision to position logic and set theory as the foundation of mathematics.
---
There needs to be somewhere a discussion of the structure of a metaphysical ground.
I wonder if this should be a separate chapter.
For now, let's assume it is in this chapter.
The idea is a kind of shape.
The properties of a center.
This is part of the "method" of this dissertation.
It may be a different paper to talk about the "strategies of the center".
That is, the way the center establishes itself as center.
Or, it could be that we can use examples of centers to describe what a center looks like and how it's possible to detect one. 
In that case, this section describes two shapes.
The first is an arc within an arc. That is the historical piece.
The second is a center. Essentially a singularity. What a center is.
A singularity has always been a concept.
Whether the point in a black hole or Vinge's technological singularity.
It is not a physical object. It is a place where the model breaks down.
So, the following sections:
First, The Trajectory.
Second, the Singularity. That Derrida's argument is really that the foundation of structure is a singularity.
The idea of an origin is a singularity.
The strategy of this text is to identify two patterns and examine their relationship and a few of their implications for knowledge in mathematics and sciences.
The first is a trajectory.
But what is it really a trajectory of?
It's the trajectory that describes the ascension and the beginnings of a decline of a particular worldview, or method of understanding the world. 
One could call it the trajectory of western metaphysics, or the trajectory of the logos.
But what it really is is a method of mastering anxiety and overcoming uncertainty.
It operates by inserting a foundation--a set of intitial claims---and delaying the examination of that foundation.
Whether by declaring them self-satisfying, or by relegating to another discipline, or authorizing them through an external, out-of-bounds authority, or attempting to destroy its history and render it unreadable or, when all else fails, shoring them up with a further, more fundamental foundation.
All of this is the substitution of center for center that Derrida describes as the history of metaphysics.
Here I only provide some further details and examples.
Of what presented itself as a structure but turned out really to be a strategy, or a method.
And in that moment, also, a strategy that could not be forever sustained.
