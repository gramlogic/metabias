# The Method of Mechanical Theorems

## Recovery of the Palimpsest
Owing to a series of lucky coincidences, two lost manuscripts of Archimedes were discovered in an old prayer book.

Sunday, August 4, 1907, the NYT reported a palimpsest found at Constantinople was of extreme interest, and the government of Turkey was resisting efforts to study it.

Prof. Schione informed Heiberg, who went to Constantinople and was aided by Turkish librarian Nicholas Tsoukaladskis.

"The original writing is in a beautiful brown ink"

Assisted by Prof H. G. Zeuthen.

"it is stated that it is of peculiar value because unlike the previously known works of Archimedes it does not contain only bare mathematical and mechanical formulae, but explains how Archimedes obtained his knolwedge through various methods and gives a wonderful insight into the mind of this great philosopher--one of the most wonderful minds that has ever existed."
